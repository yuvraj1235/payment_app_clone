Secure Mobile Payment Application
This application provides a secure and intuitive platform for mobile payments, leveraging React Native for a seamless cross-platform experience and Firebase for robust backend services. Users can efficiently manage their balances and facilitate transactions through a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

User Authentication & Profile Management: Securely log in and manage your personal user profile.

Balance Management: View your current balance in real-time, updated via Firestore listeners.

QR Code Scanning for Payments: Initiate payments quickly by scanning a recipient's unique QR code. The app extracts the recipient's Firebase User ID (UID) from the QR code.

Recipient Details Fetching: Upon scanning, the payment screen intelligently fetches and displays the recipient's username and email from Firestore using their UID, ensuring you know who you're paying.

Numeric Keypad for Amount Entry: An integrated, custom numeric keypad allows for precise and easy input of payment amounts.

Secure Transactions: All payment operations are handled through Firestore Transactions, guaranteeing atomicity (either both sender's debit and recipient's credit succeed, or both fail) for financial integrity.

Real-time Updates: Firebase's real-time capabilities ensure that balances and transaction statuses are promptly reflected across the application.

Camera Permission Handling: Robust handling of camera permissions ensures a smooth and secure QR scanning experience.

Flashlight Toggle: Easily toggle your device's flashlight within the camera view for scanning in low-light conditions.

This application is designed with security and user experience at its core, making mobile payments straightforward and reliable.
